### Day Two

Santa maintains a meticulous list, ensuring only the most deserving children receive gifts. In the realm of TypeScript, the `RemoveNaughtyChildren` type operates by filtering out any individuals who exhibit behavior that matches the criteria of being considered "naughty." If a child meets this criteria, they are excluded from the list entirely. This process ensures that only well-behaved children remain on Santa's list, ready to receive their holiday surprises.
